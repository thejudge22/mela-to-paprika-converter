## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run the Web UI

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mela-to-paprika-converter.git
   cd mela-to-paprika-converter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
   Or directly with Python:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:5000`

5. **Drag and drop** your `.melarecipe` files and click Convert!

### Configuration

You can configure the app using environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | 500 | Maximum total upload size in megabytes |
| `SECRET_KEY` | dev-key-change-in-production | Flask secret key (change in production) |
| `FLASK_PORT` | 5000 | Port to run the Flask server on |

**Example with increased limit:**
```bash
MAX_UPLOAD_MB=1000 python3 app.py
```

### Option 2: Command Line Usage

Convert a single file:
```bash
python3 convert.py path/to/recipe.melarecipe
```

Convert all files in a directory:
```bash
python3 convert.py path/to/mela/recipes/
```

The converted `.paprikarecipes` file will be created in the current directory.

## File Format Mapping

| Mela Field | Paprika Field | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| `title` | `name` | Recipe title |
| `text` | (description) | Short description |
| `ingredients` | `ingredients` | Newline-separated list |

| `prepTime` | `prep_time` | Preparation time |
| `cookTime` | `cook_time` | Cooking time |
| `totalTime` | `total_time` | Total time |
| `yield` | `servings` | Number of servings |
| `notes` | `notes` | Recipe notes |

| `categories` | `categories` | Array of category names |
| `link` | `source_url` | Original source URL |
| `images` | `photo_data` | Base64-encoded image |

## Output Format

The converter creates `.paprikarecipes` files, which are ZIP archives containing:
- One `.paprikarecipe` file per recipe (gzipped JSON)
- All recipe data including images

## Importing into Paprika

2. **Transfer** it to your iOS/Android device via email, cloud storage, or AirDrop
3. **Open** the file and select "Open in Paprika", or use Paprika's Import feature
4. Your recipes will be imported with all their details, including images

## Requirements

- Flask 2.0+ (for web UI)

## Troubleshooting

### "Request Entity Too Large" (413 Error)

The default upload limit is 500MB. If you need more:

1. **Use the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   MAX_UPLOAD_MB=1000 python3 app.py
   ```

2. **Or upload in smaller batches** - Select fewer files at once

### Conversion Failed

- Ensure files are valid `.melarecipe` JSON files
- Check that files aren't corrupted
- Try converting a single file first to isolate the issue

### Images Not Appearing in Paprika

- Mela stores images as base64 data which should transfer correctly
- Large images may take longer to process
- Verify the original Mela file has image data
